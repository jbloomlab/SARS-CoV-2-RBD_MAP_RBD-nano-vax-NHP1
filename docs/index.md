# Interactive structural visualizations of complete mapping of RBD mutations that reduce binding by serum from an NHP vaccinated with an RBD nanoparticle vaccine

Below are links to interactive visualizations of the effects of single mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) on binding by polyclonal serum from an NHP vaccinated with an RBD nanoparticle vaccine and three representative convalescent human sera for comparison.

These visualizations are built using [dms-view](https://dms-view.github.io/docs/).
These experiments are described in this preprint (**add link**), and raw data are available [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_RBD-nano-vax-NHP1/blob/main/results/supp_data/NHP_HCS_raw_data.csv). The convalescent human plasma results were previously describe in [Greaney, et al. (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312821000822).

Sites where mutations reduce binding are shown for each sample, and are mapped to the ACE2-bound RBD structure ([PDB 6M0J](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M0J)).
